This tutorial aims to give an in-depth introduction to global optimization tools, including convex and semidefinite relaxations, applied to 3D vision problems. The first goal of the tutorial is to motivate the need for global solvers by providing real-world examples where the lack of robustness results from the difficulty in solving large optimization problems to optimality. The second goal is to provide the attendees with basic mathematical and algorithmic concepts, and survey important recent advances in the area. The third goal is to outline several open research avenues: global optimization has an enormous untapped potential and it is hoped that this tutorial will inspire researchers to use modern optimization tools to solve several outstanding challenges in geometric vision.
