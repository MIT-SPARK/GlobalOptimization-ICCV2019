### *Hands-on Tutorial on Global Optimization in Matlab*
We have prepared a detailed hands-on tutorial for using global optimization in Matlab to solve **Rotation Averaging** and **Pose Graph Optimization**. We highly encourage people to read and try out the tutorial. Download the tutorial [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/GlobalOptimizationTutorial).

### *List of non-minimal solvers in computer vision and robotics*
With powerful global optimization techniques, typically based on **Semidefinite and Sums of Squares Relaxations**, the research community have developed **certifiably optimal non-minimal** solvers for many computer vision and robotics problems that used to be known as non-convex and NP-hard. We here provide a list of references to the best of our knowledge and we hope this list can keep growing!
