### *List of non-minimal solvers in computer vision and robotics*
With powerful global optimization techniques, typically based on *Semidefinite and Sums of Squares Relaxations*, the research community have developed **certifiably optimal non-minimal** solvers for many computer vision and robotics problems that used to be known as non-convex and NP-hard. We here provide a list of references to the best of our knowledge.
